The rapid advancements in deep learning have opened up new opportunities for automated
plant identification. In this project, a developed a deep learning model to classify different plant
species based on leaf images. The proposed model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN)
architecture and is trained on a large dataset of labelled leaf images.
<br>
Using transfer learning, here a pre-trained model is leveraged, and fine-tuned it to recognize
different plant species. In this plant identification system with addition to the identification of
plant species others features are present .This system can help you to aquire information
about a particular plant species. It lets us know about the plants curing particular disease
,when the user gives the disease name as input.
<br>
The performance of the model is evaluated using different metrics, including accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1-score.
<br>
The results show that the proposed deep learning model achieved a high accuracy of 99% in
identifying plant species. This is a significant improvement over existing methods and
demonstrates the potential of deep learning in automated plant identification. The model can
be further improved by incorporating additional features, such as flower or stem images, to
increase the accuracy and robustness of the classification.
<br>
Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of deep learning in plant identification, which
can have numerous applications in agriculture, forestry, and conservation.
