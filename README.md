# AyurvedicPlantRecognition_CP-II
<br>
<br>
The rapid advancements in deep learning have opened up new opportunities for automated
plant identification. In this project, a developed a deep learning model to classify different plant
species based on leaf images. The proposed model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN)
architecture and is trained on a large dataset of labelled leaf images.
<br>
<br>
Using transfer learning, here a pre-trained model is leveraged, and fine-tuned it to recognize
different plant species. In this plant identification system with addition to the identification of
plant species others features are present .This system can help you to aquire information
about a particular plant species. It lets us know about the plants curing particular disease
,when the user gives the disease name as input.
<br><br>
The performance of the model is evaluated using different metrics, including accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1-score.
<br><br>
The results show that the proposed deep learning model achieved a high accuracy of 99% in
identifying plant species. This is a significant improvement over existing methods and
demonstrates the potential of deep learning in automated plant identification. The model can
be further improved by incorporating additional features, such as flower or stem images, to
increase the accuracy and robustness of the classification.
<br><br>
Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of deep learning in plant identification, which
can have numerous applications in agriculture, forestry, and conservation.

<h2>Features</h2>
<br><br>
On the Explore page, you will find three features related to plant diseases and care: Plant for
Diseases, Know about Specific Plant, and Compare Two Plants.
<br><br>
<b>1)Plant for Diseases:</b> This feature allows you to find plants that can help you cure
specific diseases. To access this feature, click on the "Plant for Diseases" option on
the Explore page. This will redirect you to a new page with an input field where you
can enter the name of the disease you want to cure. Once you've entered the name of
the disease, click on the "Search" button, and the page will display a list of plants that
can help you cure the disease.<br>
<b>2)Know about Specific Plant:</b> This feature provides information about a specific plant.
To access this feature, click on the "Know about Specific Plant" option on the Explore
page. This will redirect you to a new page with an input field where you can enter the
name of the plant you want to know about. Once you've entered the name of the plant,
click on the "Search" button, and the page will display information about the plant,
including its care requirements, growth habits, and more.<br>
<b>3)Compare Two Plants:</b> This feature allows you to compare two different plants. To
access this feature, click on the "Compare Two Plants" option on the Explore page.
This will redirect you to a new page with two input fields where you can enter the
names of the two plants you want to compare. Once you've entered the names of the
plants, click on the "Compare" button, and the page will display a comparison of the
plants based on various factors, including their care requirements, growth habits, and
more.<br><br>
